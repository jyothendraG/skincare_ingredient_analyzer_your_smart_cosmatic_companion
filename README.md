### Application flow:

- Select between **Ingredient Analyzer** or **Product Recommendation** in the sidebar.
- For ingredient analysis, either upload an image of the skincare product ingredient label or manually enter the ingredient list.
- Click on **Analyze Ingredients** to see categorized ingredient safety details.
- For product recommendations, select your skin type, skin concern, and desired product category, then hit **Get Recommendations**.

## Datasets and Models

- **Ingredient Data:** Contains ingredient names, safety ratings, and effects.
- **Product Recommendation Data:** Details on skin types, skin concerns, product categories, and recommended products.
- **Models:** Random Forest classifier trained on product dataset, and ingredient safety data loaded for ingredient classification.

## Testing

- Unit tests cover:
  - OCR text extraction accuracy
  - Ingredient classification via fuzzy matching
  - Recommendation system predictions
- Integration tests ensure a smooth workflow from input to output.
- Tested on various real-world ingredient labels (image quality variations considered).

---

## Results and Performance

- OCR Accuracy: Approx. 90%+ for ingredient extraction from product images.
- Ingredient classification precision and recall rates >85%.
- Recommendation model accuracy around 95%.
- Detailed project report with evaluation metrics is available in the `docs/` folder.
